# Lloyd Black's Contributions

My contribution to this project is mostly higher-level design.
Specifically, I planned out the server/lobby system, most of the virtual server game mechanics, and the abstracted socket class.
My implementation of these plans can be found in the "Lloyd Code" folder, though this code wasn't used in the final product due to a time crunch and some very mysterious bugs.
