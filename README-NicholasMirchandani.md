# Nicholas Mirchandani's Contributions

My contribution to this project was a combination of project management and core logic.

In terms of management, I set up the trello and kept people on tasks on a weekly basis, constantly hosted and reminded people of the weekly 3 PM meetings on Discord, annoying them enough to remember to come on each week.  I created the GitHub, taught the tream the basic flow of using trello, got the team on the drive, and submitted all of the required content for this class (with the exception of the recorded elevator pitch).  I also got the poster completed and facilitated everything required for the Abstract Symposium.

For the typing game, I developed the core game logic that Logan eventually integrated with his pretty tilemap version of the typing game.  I also iterated on that core game logic to include networking and multiple players, given a lot of boilerplate code.

For the CTF/Virtual Server Architecture, I was responsible for the recode of the entire codebase.  Following Lloyd's uncomprehensible errors, even after hours of attempting to debug them, I figured it was best to take his design and sprint to develop a slimmed down core experience based on Lloyd's original design, which ultimately led to the lack of a virtual filesystem for each server for this iteration of the game.  Unfortunately, as of this writing (5/12/2020), I was unable to implement Logan's pretty tilemaps into the core game, simply due to a lack of time, but it should be relatively trivial to do given time.
